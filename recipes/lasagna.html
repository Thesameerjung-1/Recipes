        <!-- WROTE SOMETHING ABOUT THE DISH -->
    <p>Lasagna, a <strong>quintessential Italian dish</strong>, is a culinary symphony of flavors and textures. <br>
    Its foundation lies in layers of wide pasta sheets, each generously embracing a luscious combination of ricotta, mozzarella,<br> Parmesan, and a robust meat sauce. 
    The meat sauce, a savory amalgamation of<em> ground beef or pork, onions, garlic, tomatoes</em>,<br> and aromatic herbs, infuses the dish with depth and richness.</p>
